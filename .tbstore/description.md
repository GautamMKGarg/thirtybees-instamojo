On the bottom of "API & Plugins" page, you will see Generate Credentials / Create new Credentials button. Click on this button.

5. Now you will have to choose a platform from the drop-down menu. You can choose any of them, but I will recommend choosing option PrestaShop

6. Copy `Client Secret` & `Client Secret` and paste it in the Thirtybees' Instamojo extension.

7. Select Test mode "Enabled" if the website is currently under development and "Disabled" if the website is in Live Mode
